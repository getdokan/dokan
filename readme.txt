== Changelog ==

= v3.7.22 ( Jul 12, 2023 ) =

- **fix:** Fixed an issue where multiple withdrawal requests can be placed via API.
If a withdrawal request was placed by a vendor until that request was approved or rejected by Admin, making another withdrawal request wasn’t possible via frontend. However, the admin was able to make a withdrawal request via REST API. With this fix, this problem now has been resolved.
- **fix:** Fixed a PHP notice for importing dummy data without providing any data via REST API
endpoint: {{SERVER_URL}}/wp-json/dokan/v1/dummy-data/import
- **fix:** While updating the withdrawal request via REST API, the minimum withdrawal amount limit wasn’t considered. For example, if the minimum withdrawal limit was set to 50, for an existing withdrawal request, the admin can set the withdrawal value to less than 50. This issue has been fixed now.
endpoint: {{SERVER_URL}}/wp-json/dokan/v1/withdraw/{withdraw_id}
- **fix:** Fixed an issue where store products API was returning all products instead of published products.
endpoint: {{SERVER_URL}}/wp-json/dokan/v1/stores/{store_id}/products
- **fix:** Fixed some CSS issues on the vendor store settings page for the store banner image.

= v3.7.21 ( Jun 23, 2023 ) =

- **fix:** Fixed an issue where gateway fees from WooCommerce PayPal Payments were not being deducted from vendors’ earnings.
Previously, Dokan deducted PayPal Checkout fees from vendors’ earnings but did not deduct PayPal Payments fees. This was due to the fact that PayPal Payments did not set transaction fee metadata at the time. With this fix, Dokan now correctly deducts PayPal Payments fees from vendors’ earnings.
- **fix:** [VendorDashboard] Fixed some CSS issues under the vendor dashboard.

This inconsistency created confusion and hindered the seamless registration process. However, with the latest update, significant improvements have been made to address this issue.

This update ensures that the correct order status is displayed to vendors after they update an order. Thanks to https://github.com/rmilesson for your contribution to fixing this issue.
- **fix:** Resolved an issue where store categories filtering was not showing proper results due to nonce validation fails.
Previously, when using store categories as a direct link to filter vendors with no valid nonce key attached to it, the filtering was not working correctly and vendors were not being displayed under their assigned store category. This issue has been addressed and store categories filtering now shows the correct results.
- **fix:** Resolved inconsistent behavior of pagination on the Single Store Page.
Previously, there were several issues with the pagination on the Single Store Page, including the “Previous” text displaying like the “Next” icon, the Last Page Menu icon not showing when all menus were visible, and the Active Page Menu background color not changing from the 4th page. These issues have been addressed and the pagination behavior is now consistent.
- **fix:** Resolved an issue where the discounted price field was not displayed correctly according to the theme used.

This issue has been addressed and the discounted price field now displays correctly according to the theme used.
- **fix:** [AdminSetupWizard] The custom withdrawal method is now conditionally displayed in the admin setup wizard.
Previously, the custom withdrawal method could not be enabled in the wizard because it required the method name and type to be populated. Now, if the admin has previously saved these values, the custom withdrawal method will be displayed and can be activated in the wizard.

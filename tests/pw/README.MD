## :construction: Prep for tests

Preparation for running tests involves conducting necessary tasks and arrangements to ensure a smooth and efficient testing process. This may include setting up the testing environment, configuring dependencies, initializing resources, and performing any required setup actions.

<br/>

### :o: Build Dokan plugin

<br/>

:radio_button: Go to dokan project root directory and run

    composer i --no-dev && composer du -o && npm i && npm run build

<br/>

### :o: Install Dependencies

<br/>

:radio_button: Go to project directory

    cd tests/pw

<br/>

:radio_button: Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

<br/>

:radio_button: Install browser

```

### :o: Create Env file

Environment (env) file is used for storing configuration settings and variables specific to the testing environment. It allows managing and customizing the testing environment settings easily without modifying the test code. It provides flexibility and enables seamless configuration changes between different testing environments, ensuring efficient and effective testing of the project.

<br/>

Create .env file according to .env.example file

<br/>

```

## :test_tube: Running tests

Running tests involves executing the predefined test cases or scripts to evaluate the functionality, performance, or other aspects of a system or software application. By running tests, potential issues, bugs, or errors can be identified, providing insights into the quality and behavior of the system under test. The results obtained from running tests contribute to validating the system's compliance with requirements, verifying expected outcomes, and supporting the overall quality assurance process.

### PR Self Review Checklist:

* Code is not following code style guidelines
* Bad naming: make sure you would understand your code if you read it a few months from now.
* KISS: Keep it simple, Sweetie (not stupid!).
* DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.
* Code that is not readable: too many nested 'if's are a bad sign.
* Performance issues
* Complicated constructions that need refactoring or comments: code should almost always be self-explanatory.
* Grammar errors.

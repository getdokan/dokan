**Building assets**

1. Always add `.js` file into `src` ro `assets/src` folder, never add files directly into `assets/js` folder and less files into `assets/src/less`.
2. If any jquery plugin is needed to add, you can add it into `assets/vendor` directory.
3. When you `add` js or `less` files into `src` ro `assets/src` add that js or less as entry in `webpack.config.js` in `entryPoint` object
4. For unnecessery file cleaning or any file you don't in production you can add it in `bin/clean-useless-files.js`. Add the file dir in `targetFiles` object. The path is not absolute path, it is after the dokan plugin directory, Ex: `'assets/js/dokan-admin-product-style.js'`

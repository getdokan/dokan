![dokan](https://dokan.co/app/uploads/2024/02/dokan-new-color-logo.svg)

Welcome to the **Dokan Multivendor Marketplace** repository on **GitHub**!

**Dokan is the ultimate frontend multivendor marketplace plugin for WordPress, powered by WooCommerce, helping you build your own multivendor marketplace similar to Amazon, Shopify, eBay, and Magento.**

Here you can find the **source code**, **open issues**, and **contribute** to the development of the **Dokan plugin**.

We recommend all **developers** to follow the [**Dokan blog**](https://dokan.co/blog/) to stay up to date about everything happening in the **project**. You can also follow [**@DokanTweets**](https://x.com/DokanTweets) on **X** for the latest development updates.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get up and running with **Dokan development**, you will need to make sure that you have **installed** all of the prerequisites.

### 📋 Prerequisites

* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (>= 20.x)**: We recommend using [**NVM**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) (Node Version Manager) to ensure you're using the correct version of **Node**.
* **[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)**: Used to manage project **dependencies** and run various **scripts** involved in building and testing the **project**.
* **[PHP 7.4](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)+**: Dokan currently features a minimum **PHP** version of **7.4**. It is also needed to run **Composer** and various project build **scripts**.
* **[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)**: We use **Composer** to manage all of the dependencies for **PHP packages** and **plugins**.
* **[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/)**: A working **WordPress** installation with **WooCommerce** activated.
* **[WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/download/)**: **Dokan** is built on top of **WooCommerce** and requires it to function.

Once you've installed all of the prerequisites, the following will prepare all of the build outputs necessary for development:

```bash
# Navigate to the Dokan plugin directory
cd wp-content/plugins/dokan-lite

# Install the PHP dependencies
composer install && composer du -o

# Install the npm dependencies
npm install

# OR build for production
npm run build

# Build the assets in development mode with watch
npm run start
```
